# Reshuffle

Reshuffle - which may still be seen at https://reshuffle.com was an ipaas solution that got acquired by Twitter (now X).
The Reshuffle organisation at https://github.com/reshufflehq contains the open source repositories that made up the system.

## Reshuffle is no longer actively maintained.
